A while ago I was asked to give a presentation to my teammates at work on React. I've always been fascinated by the way most people give presentations at talks which made me research how to do them. The absolute winner was [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/). 

A couple of things made me put my mind to it

1. The documentation covered all features and aspects 
2. The framework itself contained multiple comprehensive examples covering all use cases which provided an excellent starting point.

As mentioned in the documentation the best way to install and use the framework is by cloning the repo using this command 
`$ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git`
The nice thing about cloning the whole repo is that you get a complete examples folders showcasing the features and a demo presentation which I considered RevealJS Holy Grail, I would lie if I didn't say that my whole presentation styles is copied from the demo presentation.
